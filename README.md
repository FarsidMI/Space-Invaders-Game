Classic space invaders game made with JavaScript on a HTML canvas from scratch.

In this classic game, the enemies are at the top of the screen; they move side to side and down towards our player. At random the enemies will shoot bullets. At the bottom of the screen the spaceship can shoot at the enemies. Unlike the original game, the bullets shoot much faster, which also makes the game much more fun. The objective is to stay alive, avoid the enemies bullets and eliminate the enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.
